在已装有Windows 10的电脑上装配CentOS 7后重启计算机发现没有windows 10 启动项

# 解决步骤:

* 安装utfs-3g以识别和读取windows文件系统
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo http:mirrors.aliyun.com/repo/epel-7.repo  #加源
sudo yum update; sudo yum install ntfs3g                                 
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
* 系统自动识别和添加启动项(需root权限)
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grubs/grub.cfg
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
* restart即可恢复windows启动项
