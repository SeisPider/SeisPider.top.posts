# P-SV波系计算

在双层固态界面上，利用上下界面的波速、密度和水平波幔度数据可以计算出本分界面上的所有反投射系数。

!RTCOEF calculates P/SV reflection/transmission coefficients
!   for an interface between two solid layers,based on the
!   equations on  P.149-150 of Aki and Richards. This version
!   is modified from an older routine provided bt Tom Sereno.
!
!  Inputs:       vp1  = P-wave velocity of layer 1 (top layer)
!   (real)       vs1  = S-wave velocity of layer 1
!               den1  = density of layer 1
!                vp2  = p-wave velocity of layer 2 (bottom layer)
!                vs2  = s-wave velocity of layer 2
!               den2  = density of layer 2
!              hslow  = horizontal slowness (ray parameter)
!  Returns:    rt(1)  = down P to P up         (ref1)
! (complex)    rt(2)  = down P to S up         (refl)
!              rt(3)  = down P to P down       (tran)
!              rt(4)  = down P to S down       (tran)
!              rt(5)  = down S to P up         (refl)
!              rt(6)  = down S to S up         (refl)
!              rt(7)  = down S to P down       (tran)
!              rt(8)  = down S to S down       (tran)
!              rt(9)  =   up P to P up         (tran)
!             rt(10)  =   up P to S up         (tran)
!             rt(11)  =   up P to P down       (refl)
!             rt(12)  =   up P to S down       (refl)
!             rt(13)  =   up S to P up         (tran)
!             rt(14)  =   up S to S up         (tran)
!             rt(15)  =   up S to P down       (refl)
!             rt(16)  =   up S to S down       (refl)
!  Notes:  All input variables are real
!          All output variables are complex
!          Coefficients are not energy normalized.
